## In this repository, I include the following files:

### Slides from the introductory lecture on Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) on Oct 23, 2017
### Jupyter notebook from lecture on Nov 1, 2017 where we have solved the FBA problem for the toy example using Linear Programming capabilities of SAGE
### Jupyter Notebook from lecture on Nov 6, 2017 where we have covered the basics of Cobrapy toolbox

#### Note that you can download the Cobrapy from the opencobra webpage: https://opencobra.github.io/
#### In addition to the slides on FBA, you may also consult older slides on slideshare: https://www.slideshare.net/areejit/areejit-samal-fbatutorial
